# PrimalityTest
Test for prime numbers.
-------------------------------
It can test for prime number up to 10E16 (1 Quintillion) by trying to find possible factors.

I have tried to make it efficient. It tests for large numbers within seconds.

Outdated as of 9/20/2019. Use LargePrimalityTest to test for larger numbers.
